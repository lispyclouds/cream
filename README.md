# Cream

Clojure + [Crema](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/11327): a native
binary that runs full JVM Clojure with fast startup.

Cream uses GraalVM's Crema (RuntimeClassLoading) to enable runtime `eval`,
`require`, and library loading in a native binary.

> Warning: Cream is experimental. It depends on GraalVM Crema (EA) and a
> custom Clojure fork. Do not use in production.

## Install

Download from the [latest dev release](https://github.com/borkdude/cream/releases/tag/dev):

```sh
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -sL https://github.com/borkdude/cream/releases/download/dev/cream-macos-aarch64.tar.gz | tar xz
# Linux (x86_64)
curl -sL https://github.com/borkdude/cream/releases/download/dev/cream-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
# Windows (PowerShell)
# Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/borkdude/cream/releases/download/dev/cream-windows-amd64.zip -OutFile cream.zip
# Expand-Archive cream.zip -DestinationPath .

sudo mv cream /usr/local/bin/  # macOS/Linux
```

Or build from source (see [Building from source](#building-from-source)).

## Quick start

```sh
$ ./cream -M -e '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
```

## Loading libraries at runtime

Use `-Scp` to add JARs to the classpath:

```sh
./cream -Scp "$(clojure -Spath -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/data.json {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}')" \
  -M -e '(do (require (quote [clojure.data.json :as json])) (json/write-str {:a 1}))'
;; => "{\"a\":1}"
```

## Requirements

Some Java interop may require `JAVA_HOME` pointing to a JDK installation, as
Crema loads certain classes at runtime from the JDK's `lib/modules` (JRT
filesystem). Pure Clojure code works without `JAVA_HOME`.

## Known limitations

- May need `JAVA_HOME` for Java interop — some JDK classes require `JAVA_HOME` at runtime; pure Clojure works without it
- Requires a lightly patched Clojure fork — minor workarounds for Crema
  quirks in `RT.java`, `Var.java`, and `Compiler.java`
  ([details](doc/technical.md#fork-changes))
- Java enum support broken — `enum.values()` and `EnumMap` crash in
  Crema's interpreter. Affects http-kit, cheshire, clj-yaml, and other
  libraries using Java enums
- `Class.forName` not dispatchable — GraalVM inlines `Class.forName`
  substitutions at call sites, so Crema's interpreter can't dispatch to it.
  The Clojure fork redirects to `RT.classForName` as a workaround, but Java
  `.class` files calling `Class.forName` directly will still fail
- Large binary — ~300MB (includes Crema interpreter and preserved packages)
- Crema is EA — GraalVM's RuntimeClassLoading is experimental and only
  available in [EA builds](https://github.com/graalvm/oracle-graalvm-ea-builds)

See [doc/technical.md](doc/technical.md) for the full list of known issues and
workarounds.

## Cream vs Babashka

| | Cream | [Babashka](https://babashka.org) |
|---|---|---|
| Clojure | Full JVM Clojure (1.13 fork) | SCI interpreter (subset) |
| Library loading | Any library from JARs at runtime | Built-in set + pods |
| Java interop | Full (runtime class loading) | Limited to compiled-in classes |
| Startup | ~20ms | ~5ms |
| Binary size | ~300MB | ~30MB |
| Standalone | Mostly (may need `JAVA_HOME` for Java interop) | Yes |
| Maturity | Experimental | Production-ready |

When cream might make sense: you need full Clojure compatibility, arbitrary
library loading, or Java interop beyond what babashka offers.

When babashka is better: scripting, tasks, CI glue, or anything where a
standalone binary, fast startup, and a mature ecosystem matter.

## Tested libraries

Libraries are tested against the cream binary using `bb run-lib-tests`.

| [clj-yaml](https://github.com/clj-commons/clj-yaml) | | Fails | SnakeYaml enum NPE in Crema |

Pure Clojure libraries generally work. Libraries using Java interop work when
the relevant packages are preserved. Libraries using Java enums fail due to a
Crema bug ([known limitation](#known-limitations)).

## Building from source

Requires a GraalVM EA build with RuntimeClassLoading support.

1. Install the [custom Clojure fork](https://github.com/borkdude/clojure/tree/crema):
   ```sh
   git clone -b crema https://github.com/borkdude/clojure.git /tmp/clojure-fork
   cd /tmp/clojure-fork && mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
   ```

2. Build the native binary:
   ```sh
   GRAALVM_HOME=/path/to/graalvm bb build-native
   ```

## Future work

- Fully standalone binary — investigate whether JRT metadata can be bundled
  in the binary to eliminate the `JAVA_HOME` requirement for Java interop
- Enum support — blocked on Crema fixing `enum.values()` /
  `InterpreterResolvedObjectType.getDeclaredMethodsList()` NPE. Would unblock
  http-kit, cheshire, clj-yaml
- Reduce binary size — currently ~300MB due to preserved packages and
  Crema interpreter overhead
- nREPL support — enable interactive development with editor integration
